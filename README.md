# Warehouse Management System (WMS) for Applied Programming with Python Course

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Warehouse Management System (WMS) using Python and Command Line Interface (CLI) technology. The WMS allows users to manage inventory efficiently, including viewing current stock, adding new products, adjusting quantities, and deleting items from inventory.

## Purpose

This application is developed as part of the coursework for the Applied Programming with Python course at Ionian University. It serves as a learning tool for students to understand software development concepts and Python programming principles.

## Key Features

- **Command Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI for inventory management.
- **Flexible Inventory Management**: Add, update, delete, and view products seamlessly.
- **Hardware Product Management**: Specifically designed for managing hardware products like computer components, electronics, and networking equipment.
- **Statistical Insights**: Track inventory statistics for informed decision-making.

## Methodology

The implementation methodology follows a structured approach:
1. **Problem Analysis**: Identify requirements and select appropriate technologies.
2. **Development Stages**: Develop core functionalities including storage model, SQLite database setup, and CLI algorithm.
3. **Enhancements**: Add additional features such as statistical insights and a user interface using Flask.

## Deliverables

- **Application Code**: Fully functional and well-documented code with comments for readability.
- **User Documentation**: Comprehensive guide with usage instructions for both CLI and frontend.
- **Final Report**: Detailed report outlining project activities and application evolution.
- **GitHub Repository**: Accessible repository with installation and usage instructions.
