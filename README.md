# Warehouse Management System (WMS) with Python CLI

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Warehouse Management System (WMS) using Python and Command Line Interface (CLI) technology. The WMS allows users to manage inventory efficiently, including viewing current stock, adding new products, adjusting quantities, and deleting items from inventory.

## Why WMS?

Warehouse Management Systems are crucial for businesses to streamline their warehouse operations, from goods receipt to order fulfillment. By developing a WMS with Python, we aim to provide a flexible solution tailored to specific business needs, leveraging Python's rapid development capabilities and robust libraries.

## Key Features

- **Command Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI for inventory management.
- **Flexible Inventory Management**: Add, update, delete, and view products seamlessly.
- **Hardware Product Management**: Specifically designed for managing hardware products like computer components, electronics, and networking equipment.
- **Statistical Insights**: Track inventory statistics for informed decision-making.
- **Scalability and Customization**: Easily extend and customize the system to suit unique business requirements.

## Methodology

The implementation methodology follows a structured approach:
1. **Problem Analysis**: Identify requirements and select appropriate technologies.
2. **Development Stages**: Develop core functionalities including storage model, SQLite database setup, and CLI algorithm.
3. **Enhancements**: Add additional features such as statistical insights and a user interface using Flask.

## Deliverables
